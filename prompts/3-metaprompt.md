## ✨ Characteristics and Main Functionalities

At its core, the product lets users log all types of transactions, tag and
categorize them, handle currency conversions, and link bank accounts. It
supports recurring transactions, split payments (installments), and detailed
breakdowns with automatic tax and deduction calculations. Users can upload
receipts and track gross vs. net amounts effortlessly.

Beyond transactions, it offers powerful dashboards and charts to visualize
income, expenses, and budget usage over time. Spending can be classified as
essential, wants, savings, or investing, and users can set short- and long-term
financial goals or simulate scenarios like a salary raise or new mortgage.

To keep users informed, the system provides smart notifications: payday
reminders, overspending alerts, and goal progress nudges. It works seamlessly
across devices with real-time sync and offline logging. Security is built-in
with encryption, secure authentication, and optional two-factor login.
